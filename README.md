This repository contains my **Linux Laboratory work** completed as part of the **BTech Computer Science & Engineering curriculum**.

---

### 📘 Overview
It showcases a collection of systematically organised Linux experiments aimed at developing a strong **hands-on understanding of Linux and UNIX-based operating systems**.  
Each experiment is documented with clarity to ensure ease of understanding and reproducibility.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Gain practical exposure to **Linux system commands and utilities**
- Strengthen **command-line proficiency** and problem-solving skills
- Ensure **accurate execution** of tasks with proper outputs
- Maintain **clear, professional, and well-structured documentation**
