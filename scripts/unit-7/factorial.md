## Factorial

### Code

### Line by Line Explanation
-  #!/bin/bash — Shebang. Tells the OS to run this script with /bin/bash (the Bash shell).

- "# factorial.sh "— Comment: short name/description of the file (ignored by the shell).

- "Usage: ./factorial.sh 5 "— Comment: example of how to call the script.

- fact() { — Start of a function named fact. Everything up to the matching } is the function body.

- n=$1 — Assign the function's first positional argument to variable n. (Note: this is a global variable unless you use local n=$1.)

- if [ "$n" -le 1 ]; then — Numeric test: if $n is less than or equal to 1 (base case for factorial), run the then branch. -le is “less than or equal”. Quoting "$n" protects against empty values.

- echo 1 — Print 1 to stdout (the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1). This is the function's output for the base case.

- return — Exit the function immediately and return control to the caller. (No numeric return value is provided; return without an argument gives exit status 0.)

- fi — End of the if block.

- res=1 — Initialize the accumulator variable res to 1. This will hold the running product. (Again, res is global unless declared local.)

- for ((i=2;i<=n;i++)); do — C-style for loop (arithmetic context): start i at 2, loop while i <= n, increment i by 1 each iteration. This multiplies numbers 2..n.

- res=$(( res * i )) — Arithmetic evaluation and assignment: multiply res by i and store back in res. $(( ... )) performs integer arithmetic.

- done — End of the for loop.

- echo "$res" — Print the final factorial result to stdout. The function communicates its result by printing (so callers use command substitution to capture it).

- } — End of the fact function definition

- (blank line — ignored; separates function from main script)

- "if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then "— Check the number of command-line arguments. $# is the count; -lt 1 means “less than 1”. If no arguments were given, run the then branch.

- echo "Usage: $0 <non-negative-integer> [another ...]" — Print a usage message. $0 expands to the script name as invoked. The message shows the script expects at least one non-negative integer, and can accept more.

- exit 1 — Exit the entire script with status 1 (conventional non-zero status = error).

- fi — End of the if block.

- (blank line — ignored; readability)

- for arg in "$@"; do — Iterate over all command-line arguments ("$@" preserves each argument as a separate word, including those containing spaces). Each iteration sets arg to the next argument.

- if ! [[ $arg =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then — Validate arg with a regex inside [[ ]]: ^[0-9]+$ matches only one or more digits (non-negative integers). The leading ! negates the test — so this if triggers when arg is not a non-negative integer. Note: [[ ... =~ ... ]] is Bash’s regex match operator.

- echo "$arg: not a non-negative integer, skipping." — Inform the user that this argument is invalid and will be skipped.

- continue — Skip the rest of the loop body for this argument and proceed to the next arg.

- fi — End of the validation if.

- echo "$arg! = $(fact "$arg")" — Compute and print the factorial: $(fact "$arg") runs the fact function with the argument and substitutes its stdout (the factorial). The whole line prints a friendly n! = result message. Quoting "$arg" ensures arguments with spaces (not relevant for digits but good habit) are passed safely.

- done — End of the for loop (finished processing all arguments).
