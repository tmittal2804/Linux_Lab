# ARMSTRONG NUMBER 
An Armstrong number is an integer that is equal to the sum of each of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. Example: 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.
## Orignal script 
```bash

#!/bin/bash
# armstrong.sh
# Usage: ./Armstrong.sh 153

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0  <non-negative-integer>"
  exit 1
fi

n="$1"
if ! [[ $n =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Input must be a non-negative integer."
  exit 1
fi

# count digits
temp="$n"; digits=0
while [ "$temp" -gt 0 ]; do
  temp=$(( temp / 10 ))
  ((digits++))
done
# handle zero
[ $digits -eq 0 ] && digits=1

sum=0
temp="$n"
while [ "$temp" -gt 0 ]; do
  d=$(( temp % 10 ))
  # compute d^digits
  pow=1
  for ((i=0;i<digits;i++)); do pow=$(( pow * d )); done
  sum=$(( sum + pow ))
  temp=$(( temp / 10 ))
done

if [ "$sum" -eq "$n" ]; then
  echo "$n is an Armstrong number."
else
  echo "$n is NOT an Armstrong number (sum=$sum)."
fi

```
## LINE BY LINE EXPLANATION 

#### 1. Shebang 

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```
Tells the Operating system to execute this file with /bin/bash (the Bash shell).

#### 2.

```bash
# Armstrong.sh
```
File name or short description for the user

#### 3.

```bash
# Usage: ./Armstrong.sh 153
```
Showing the command line to run,Number added after sh file is the number on which the operation will be performed

#### 4. 
A line left to improve the readiability of the code, it has no effeect on execution.

#### 5.

```bash
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
```
- "$#" â†’ This is a special variable in Bash. It tells you how many arguments you gave to the script when running it.
- "-ne"â†’ This means "not equal".
- "1"â†’ The script expects only 1 argument.
- so the line checks,
ðŸ‘‰ "Did the user give something other than 1 argument?"
1) If yes â†’ then go inside the then block (usually to show an error or usage message).
2) If no (exactly 1 argument given) â†’ skip the then block and continue the script.

#### 6.

```bash
echo "Usage: $0 <non-negative-integer>"
```
- echo
A shell builtin that writes text to standard output (stdout). It prints whatever follows it, then a newline (usually).
- "Usage: $0 <non-negative-integer>"
This is the string echo will print. Because itâ€™s in double quotes, variable expansion happens, and the text is kept together (no word-splitting).
- $0
A special shell variable that expands to how the script was invoked.

#### 7.

```bash
exit 1
```
- Exits the script with status 1

#### 8.
